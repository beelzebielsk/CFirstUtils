# README

This project creates a few utilities to deal with a cumbersome front-end for registration at CUNY: CUNYFirst.

Right now, the programs here are early pieces of nascent ideas.

# Early Goals

Eventually, I hope to create:
- A way to fetch course data from CUNYFirst on a regular interval (such as once a day, or once a week). This prevents one from having to use the website unless absolutely necessary.

- A schedule maker, which will give the user the list of all possible schedules that meet some constraints.

- A curriculum grid parser, which will allow the schedule maker to be aware of degree requirements when creating schedules without needing tedious user input.

- A GUI to the schedule maker, to better visualize possible schedules.
